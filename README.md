# Hierarchical clustering in Java

A simple hierarchical clustering implementation in Java, and dendrogram-based visualization.

## Todo

- [ ] translate the project's description in English
- [ ] add UML class diagrams from the `images` directory
- [ ] reorganize file architecture to separate the project's description from the class templates
- [ ] in the `src` directory, should the java files be in a specific package (depends on whether the students will have seen the package notion at this point)
- [ ] include questions requiring the students to perform a git clone
- [ ] fix checkboxes in markdown
