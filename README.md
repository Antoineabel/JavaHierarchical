# Hierarchical clustering in Java

A simple hierarchical clustering implementation in Java, and dendrogram-based visualization.

## Todo

- [x] translate the project's description in English
- [ ] add UML class diagrams from the `images` directory
- [x] reorganize file architecture to separate the project's description from the class templates
- [ ] in the `src` directory, should the java files be in a specific package (depends on whether the students will have seen the package notion at this point) 
- [ ] should `GroupOfStudents` inherit from `java.util.Vector` (as in the code) or from `ArrayList` (as in the text)? 
- [x] include questions requiring the students to perform a git clone 
- [ ] add a `doc` directory and ask the students to run javadoc 
- [x] add an empty `classes` or `bin` directory for compiling java source files (and adapt the `.gitignore`)
